Today is really special for me, because my `Macbook Air 13"` is already one year old. I remember that I felt unforgettable as soon as I touched her. I also remember that why did I think she is the one for me, do you want to know why?

Because of `Ruby on Rails`. I would like to learn that since I visited [this blog](http://blog.xdite.net/). Those posts show me how wonderful Rails is, its porpose is to create websites, that's what I want!

Few days later, I bought the the famous Rails developer, xdite, her book [Rails 101 (It's free now)](https://leanpub.com/rails-101). I impressed by a part of paragraph:

> Mac 是最好的 Ruby on Rails 開發環境，馬上買一台！

So I got Macbook immediatrly. I am easy to be incfuenced by someone, but I do not regret to do this. I think this pricy stuff can make money for me soon. But such a pitty, I did not try my best to learn Rails in the last year.

Now, I want to recreate my ambition. I am going to write down my thoughts of learning techniques here to train my writing skill. That's why I spend afternoon to build this blog using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), you can follow [Octopress documentation](http://octopress.org/docs/) to create it. If you have no idea why you must create a blog and insist on blogging, I believe [Why You Should Write Daily](http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/) may help you much.

# Anyway, let's blog!
